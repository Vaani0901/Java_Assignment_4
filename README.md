All data members are private.
The Card class has the following methods:
a. createDeck(): Creates a deck of 52 cards with all possible combinations of suits and ranks.
b. printCard(): Prints the rank and suit of a card.
c. printDeck(): Prints the entire deck of cards.
d. sameCard(): Checks if two cards are the same by comparing their rank and suit values.
e. compareCard(): Compares two cards based on their rank values.
f. sortCard(): Sorts the deck of cards in ascending order based on their rank values.
g. findCard(): Searches through the deck of cards to see whether it contains a certain card.
h. dealCards(): Prints 5 random cards from the existing deck.
How to use the program:
